Parallel Sobel Edge Detection in Java

1. This code is made up of 3 main classes: SobelSequential, SobelParallel and Main which can all be found in src/sobel

2. Please note that the Main works in 2 modes. When you want to do the Single Image processing and comparison, you select as the mode argument "single inputsample.jpg".

For example here, you can put the argument as "single sample4K.jpg", click Apply and then Run. I used IntelliJ.

The second mode is the batch processing (all 4 images at the same time). In this case, the mode argument is "batch".

3. You can find the original images in "input" file, and their filtered images in "outputs".

4. The final report is Report.pdf

Thank you.
